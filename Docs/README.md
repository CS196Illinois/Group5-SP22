# Documentation

The Docs folder’s purpose is to store the project documentation. There are two required files, although you can feel free to add more files as necessary. The two required files are as follows:
## RUN.md
This file will contain instructions for installing any dependencies necessary to run the project, as well as on how to run the project itself. 
Normally, this would be in the README, but for the sake of making the grading process easier, we have decided to keep them separate.
## PLAN.md
This file will contain all the long-term and short-term planning needed for the project. As is the nature of many projects, this will likely be updated over time.
- Map out what the finished project will look like/how it will run
    - Eg: “Build a website that does X.”
- Break down the finished project into subgoals
    - Eg: “We will need to integrate X library, create Y different pages on the frontend, etc”
- Try to distribute subgoals across the different sprints. This will not be set in stone and you will be able to change it as you progress. The goal is just to ensure your group has some sort of roadmap to finish the project by the end of the semester.
    - Eg: “By the end of sprint X, we should have Y done”
